    "However, there's a number of problems that may arise when conducting z-tests which might become too small and less powerful and then lead to *Multicollinearity*. For example, a low z-test on an explanatory variable increases the chances of *Type II errors* which means failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. So to correct for Multicollinearity, we should exclude one or more of the independent variables from the regression model. Therefore, in our analysis, we have to add only the factors that are the most predictor**."
